Virtual FM synthesizer

Don't pull this yet; it's still under development.
It's currently a mix of an adapter version of X-Synth as a framework, with a port of Dexter as the FM engine.

## Roadmap:
- Get VST up and running (done)
- Port Dexter (done), and integrate (partially done)
- Allow more than 6 operators, and custom operator routing algorithms (to do)
- Add waveforms other than sine (like the ones that exist in 4-op synths and FS1R, like res and format) (to do)
- Implement formant sequence playback (to do)
- Implement GUI (to do)
- ...
